# Color Detecting Vehicle Bot
The objective of the project is to apply Image Processing Techniques to Hardware in this case, a vehicle bot powered by an Arduino UNO.
The car moves when green light is shown and stops when red is shown. The processing is done by OpenCV library for Python and via PySerial, commands are sent to the Arduino Board.

# Libraries
OpenCV,
Numpy,
PySerial,
