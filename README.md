# Color Detecting Moving Bot
I am making a Traffic Light System- with 2 lights, red and green,controlled using a NodeMCU and a webserver on a local host.
The Arduino powered car is made such that it will accelerate on seeing GREEN and decelerate on seeing RED. This is made possible via OpenCV and Python
